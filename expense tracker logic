I will be Creating a simple Personal Expense Tracker that helps you manage daily expenses.
This project will incorporate all the Python basics I've learned.

Logic Overview of the Personal Expense Tracker:

1.Initialize Expenses:
An empty list expenses is used to store all the expense entries.


2.Add Expenses Functionality (addExpenses):
Prompt the user to input the name, category, and amount of an expense.
Store this information as a dictionary and append it to the expenses list.
Notify the user of successful addition.


3.View Expenses Functionality (viewExpenses):
If the expenses list is empty, inform the user that no expenses have been added yet.
Otherwise, loop through the expenses list and display each expense.


4.Delete Expenses Functionality (deleteExpenses):
If no expenses exist, inform the user and exit the function.
Otherwise, display all expenses with their corresponding index numbers.
Prompt the user to enter the number of the expense to delete.
Validate the input; if valid, delete the selected expense using .pop(). If invalid, inform the user.


5.Main Menu (mainMenu):
Display the list of available options: Add, View, Delete expenses, or Exit.
Loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.


6.Program Execution:
Use an infinite while loop to repeatedly display the menu and handle user inputs.
Exit the loop and terminate the program when the user selects an invalid option or chooses to quit.
